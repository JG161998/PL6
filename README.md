 Implementing, and testing a solution for problem of finding a shortest path 
between two vertices s and t of a weighted graph G = <V, E>. Having graph be represented 
with an adjacency matrix, with entries representing weights with a value of 0 represents no 
edge. Making graph G alongside vertices s and t be provided in a text file. Using Dijkstra's 
algorithm will be used for finding the shortest path between s and t.
